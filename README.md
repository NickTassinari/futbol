## Project Organization
- We're using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4kEFl1HGiODQHxy32ZT2RX/Futbol?node-id=10-108&t=GdnVm8WqnI1rBy03-0) to design our code.
- We're using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/NickTassinari/projects/2) for project organization.
- We chose to use GitHub Projects to gain experience with this platform. We also liked that GitHub Projects can be linked to the actual repository. We picked the project management tool that seemed most attractive and viable to all of us without further ado. 

## Code Design
