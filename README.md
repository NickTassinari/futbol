# Team Awesome Futbol
##### *AKA Nick & the BBs*
##### *AKA Nick's Abandonment Issues Redux: The Team*

## Check-ins:
- We'll have stand-up meetings @ 8:30 am on weekdays. 
- We'll check in on slack regularly.
- We plan to break up into smaller groups and code in pairs as needed.
- We plan to hang out in the same study hall during scheduled work times.
- Our retro will be planned and conducted on Friday, April 21st from 2-4 pm.
- We'll check-in again on Sunday, April 23rd therafter.

## Project Organization
- We're using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4kEFl1HGiODQHxy32ZT2RX/Futbol?node-id=10-108&t=GdnVm8WqnI1rBy03-0) to design our code.
- We're using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/NickTassinari/projects/2) for project organization.
- We chose to use GitHub Projects to gain experience with this platform. We also liked that GitHub Projects can be linked to the actual repository. We picked the project management tool that seemed most attractive and viable to all of us without further ado. 

## Code Design
- Our code design diagram is on the Figma link provided below.

## DTRs
- We completed our initial DTR on 4/17/23, taking notes with with grey font.
- We completed our Re-DTR on 4/20/23, taking notes with maroon font.
- Our DTR document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/).

## Deliverables for Retro

                          TOP 3 THINGS THAT WENT WELL DURING YOUR PROJECT

                                  EFFECTIV COMMUNICATION

    Utilizing Slack for Pull Requests and Merges: We understand the importance of clear communication in our team's workflow. We will use Slack messages to notify team members about pull requests and merges, ensuring that everyone is up to date with the latest developments and changes in the project.

    Keeping Each Other Informed: We recognize the value of keeping all team members on the same page. Regularly bringing each other up to speed on project progress, challenges, and updates will foster a collaborative environment where everyone is well-informed and can contribute effectively.

    Thoughtful Team Naming: We acknowledge the significance of thoughtful team naming conventions to avoid confusion and streamline our project's organization. We will establish clear and meaningful team names that reflect the purpose and scope of each group, making it easy for team members to identify and collaborate with the appropriate group.

    Thoughtful PR Comments: We recognize the importance of providing constructive feedback and insights during the review process. We will make an effort to leave thoughtful and constructive comments on pull requests to facilitate meaningful discussions and promote continuous improvement in our project.
        
                                  POSITIVE TEAM DYNAMICS

    Camaraderie: We value a positive and inclusive team environment where mutual respect, trust, and support are fostered. We encourage camaraderie among team members, creating a sense of belonging and a supportive atmosphere that promotes collaboration and creativity.

    Banter: We understand the importance of friendly banter and casual interactions in building team rapport and fostering a positive work culture. We encourage light-hearted conversations and banter that help create strong team bonds and boost team morale.

    Morning Coffee Stand-ups: We recognize the value of regular team check-ins to align our efforts and start the day on the same page. We will hold morning coffee stand-ups, where team members can share updates, discuss progress, and address any challenges, ensuring effective communication and coordination among team members. These stand-ups will also provide an opportunity to foster team camaraderie and build a sense of community within our project team.
        
                                  COLLABORATIVE DECISION MAKING

    Consensus: We believe in fostering a collaborative decision-making process within our team. We strive to reach a consensus by actively involving all team members in discussions and considering diverse perspectives to make informed decisions that benefit the project as a whole.

    Establishing Boundaries for Time Management: We understand that effective time management is crucial to project success. To ensure optimal productivity, we will establish clear boundaries and guidelines for managing our time efficiently, avoiding unnecessary distractions, and staying focused on project tasks and goals.

    Project Design: We recognize the significance of thoughtful project design in delivering a successful outcome. We will approach project design with careful consideration, involving all team members in the decision-making process and leveraging their expertise to create a well-structured and robust project plan. Through collaborative project design, we aim to ensure that the project meets all its objectives and delivers the desired results.

                          TOP 3 THINGS YOUR TEAM WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY NEXT TIME

                                  Asynchronous Work Management 

   During our initial Discussion to Review (DTR) session, we acknowledged the importance of addressing asynchronous work, but did not delve into the specifics. However, we have made a note to prioritize this topic for early discussion and resolution. We understand that managing asynchronous work is crucial to our project's success, and we are committed to establishing clear guidelines and communication channels to effectively handle asynchronous tasks and ensure smooth collaboration among team members.

                                  Strategic Git Project Planning

   We recognized that establishing a well-structured Git project would have greatly facilitated the flow of our project. Using Git as a foundation, we could have built our project around a systematic approach to accomplish the project's objectives. By leveraging Git's features and workflow, we could have effectively coordinated our team's efforts, optimized collaboration, and ensured a streamlined development process. Moving forward, we will prioritize meticulous planning and utilization of Git to establish a solid foundation for our project's success.

                                   DONT PR/MERGE TO MAIN

  We encountered an issue where we inadvertently made pull requests without carefully selecting the appropriate branch before submitting. Although this oversight did not cause any immediate problems in our project, we recognize the potential risks it poses. To mitigate this, we have learned from our experience and will now double-check and ensure the correct branch is selected before submitting any pull requests in the future. Our team is committed to maintaining strict adherence to this protocol to prevent any unintended consequences and ensure smooth integration of changes into the main branch.
